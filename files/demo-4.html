							<!-- Text -->
							<p class="p-lg grey-color pb-35">Unemployment can be seen as one of the severe
								socio-economic problems that are being faced by both developing and the developed
								countries. For example, in India, the rate of unemployment has been increasing rapidly
								since the 2000s. Today, billions of people are interacting over the internet in several
								different ways and is exponentially easier to operate. Overtime the problem in helping
								people get jobs or helping corporates find people has changed from ‘simply finding the
								people’ to ‘locating the right people’. This demand has risen due to the sheer explosion
								of the number of people and job opportunities floating on the Internet. This has led to
								job portals slowly losing their relevance in the traditional sense. However, following
								are some of the problems associated with current digital recruitment portals</p>

						</div>

						<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
							<div class="fbox-6 mb-50 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4s">

								<!-- Title -->
								<h5 class="h5-sm"> Rise in Technical Issues</h5>

								<!-- Text -->
								<p class="grey-color">During online interviews on the free video platforms like Skype or
									Zoom video calls, it is possible to encounter technical faults. It can be quite
									embarrassing for a recruiter to be suddenly switched out of a conversation or call
									due to an electrical outage, while having an unstable internet connection can be
									awkward. This also means if the company isn’t good at technology, they might
									encounter such glitches more often
								</p>

						<!-- FEATURE BOX #2 -->
						<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
							<div class="fbox-6 mb-50 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">

								<!-- Title -->
								<h5 class="h5-sm"> Lack of AI integrated features</h5>

								<!-- Text -->
								<p class="grey-color">Artificial Intelligence (AI) can significantly enhance various
									aspects of the job recruitment process, streamlining workflows, improving
									efficiency, and enhancing the overall experience for both recruiters and candidates.
									However, none of the existing job portals incorporate AI features for job
									recruitment
								</p>

						</div>


						<!-- FEATURE BOX #3 -->
						<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
							<div class="fbox-6 mb-50 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.8s">

								<!-- Title -->
								<h5 class="h5-sm"> Lack of useful information</h5>

								<!-- Text -->
								<p class="grey-color">Job portals pretty much work by using resume information to match
									people. Unfortunately, information available through job portals is not enough to do
									an intelligent match. Recruiters see very similar resumes of hundreds of applicants
									making it impossible to figure out which candidate seems to be relevant or better
									for the job at hand
								</p>

							</div>
						</div>


						<!-- FEATURE BOX #4 -->
						<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
							<div class="fbox-6 mb-50 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">

								<!-- Title -->
								<h5 class="h5-sm"> Fraudulent applications</h5>

								<!-- Text -->
								<p class="grey-color">Some applications might be fake to get information about the
									company or hiring officer (a common espionage tactic). Simultaneously, spammers
									might use the information posted online to promote a service or product
								</p>

							</div>
						</div>


						<!-- FEATURE BOX #5 -->
						<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
							<div class="fbox-6 mb-50 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1.2s">

								<!-- Title -->
								<h5 class="h5-sm"> Lack of data-driven recruitment process</h5>

								<!-- Text -->
								<p class="grey-color">Data analysis helps in making the online recruitment process more
									effective and efficient. Hiring analytics can help your company achieve its desired
									business results
								</p>

						</div>


						<!-- FEATURE BOX #6 -->
						<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
							<div class="fbox-6 mb-50 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1.4s">

								<!-- Title -->
								<h5 class="h5-sm"> Biased recruitment process</h5>

								<!-- Text -->
								<p class="grey-color">A stereotypical recruitment process that does not promote
									diversity or enhance inclusion makes the hiring monotonous and subjective. Most
									companies fail to commit objective hiring due to unconscious bias, resulting in the
									loss of great candidates. An unprejudiced recruitment process ensures diversity in
									the workforce and also helps in creating a strong brand.

							platforms</p>
					</div>

					<!-- STATISTIC BLOCK #4 -->
					<div class="col-md-4">
